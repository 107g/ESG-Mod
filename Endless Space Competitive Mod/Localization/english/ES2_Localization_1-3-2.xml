  <!-- Religious tier 1 -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L01ESGShortTitle">Blood From Stones Edict</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L01ESGTitle">Holy Decree Authorizing Pilgrimage To the Firmament</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L01ESGDescription">As taught by religious leaders since the earliest days of the empire, the stars hold untold treasures and knowledge, and are destined to belong to your people alone. Seen by some as a new form of tithing, this law authorizes heroes to send fleets on pilgrimages to wondrous nodes throughout the galaxy for the purposes of exploration and revelation. Such fleets often return coated in dust, with crews touched by divine inspiration.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Religious tier 4 -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L04ESGShortTitle">Charitable Champions Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L04ESGTitle">Divine Framework for Heroic Almsgiving</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L04ESGDescription">Through aggressive teachings of the sacred nature of Dust and its history, each Hero learns to view Dust as the holy artifact it is, and lining the empire's coffers becomes a task of religous importance.</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- Militarist tier 4 -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L04ESGShortTitle">Canned Grunts</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L04ESGTitle">Regulatory Act for Rotating Cryosleep and Expanded Naval Psychological Support</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L04ESGDescription">Orbital marines have simultaneously the most glorious and boring posts in our military, marked by long periods of silent discomfort in a cramped metal tube and short bursts of unimaginable terror and destruction on alien worlds. While indefinite icing has proven to make the battles more mentally straining, a rotating schedule of light cryosleep has allowed us to fit more soldiers into ships, while releasing just a few at a time into a far more spacious controlled environment with entertainment and psychological support far better than normal shore-leave.</LocalizationPair>

 	<!-- Tier 5 and 6 laws for each party (excluding those that were simply moved from vanilla) -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP01L05ShortTitle">New Deal</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP01L05Title">Economy Jumpstart and Stimulus Bill</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP01L05Description">In truth, this bill is not a single law, but a small collection of new regulations, economic and social relief programs, and tax amendments with the aim of galvanizing a beleaguered workforce. A feeling of sweeping economic change motivates workers to rise up, but as the novelty wears off and corporations find new ways to sidestep these regulations, enthusiasm wanes.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP02L05ShortTitle">Information Economy</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP02L05Title">Stimulus Through Innovation Protocol</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP02L05Description">In contrast to the more industrial ages of eons past and their focus on the manufacturing of goods, post-scientific revolution economics revolve around knowledge of the economy and the ability to apply that knowledge. By educating economic elites on the intricacies of understanding and manipulating an electronic market, profit margins rise across the board. In turn, this increased education of powerful figures leads to greater scientific innovation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP03L06ShortTitle">Patient Defense Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP03L06Title">Clarification on Foreign Misunderstanding of Our Abilities</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP03L06Description">Warmongers have often misunderstood unwillingness to use violence for inability, and on many occasions have been swiftly corrected on the matter. With this law we hope to correct our enemies in much the same way, using simulations and advanced implants to create a generation of officers with an enhanced capacity for naval tactics, and the necessary mental safeguards to never use them offensively or retain the information once the implants are removed.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP04L05ShortTitle">Roughing It</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP04L05Title">Curriculum Adjustment in Favor of Planetary Engagement</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP04L05Description">While many societies have optional classes or clubs to teach ecological basics, the ability to creatively interface with the environment for study, food, or materials is often lacking. In order to ensure long term ecological stability, planetary education must be expanded from a hobby to a course load, ranging from sand-worm watching field trips for children to intensive fieldwork in areas like xenobiology, hollow-world fungal food systems, and geothermal "volcanic metallurgy" in college.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP04L06Title">Public Planting of Special Specimens with Military Applications Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP04L06Description">The creation of "self-sealing" materials to protect ships has been understood since long before we left our home system, but it has always been too expensive or slow for use in stellar battlefields, restricted only to satellites or science drones. However, genetically modified plants can be distributed to the public to cheaply and sustainably mass produce a sap which achieves even greater effects, requiring only regular pickup by the government to keep ships well supplied with these amber defenses.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L05ShortTitle">Deific Oversight Act</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L05Title">Justification For Holy Governmental Reform</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L05Description">Through reinterpretations of ancient scriptures, the case can be made that the empire has fallen into a state of blasphemous disrepair, and that an increase in reverence is necessary for societal enlightenment. Heroes are deployed to systems to instruct wayward congregations how to devote themselves towards self-betterment and righteous causes. Graduates of this program lead ascetic and pious lives, and encourage their neighbors to follow in their footsteps.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L06Title">Righteous and Unimpeachable Edict of Holy Warfare</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP05L06Description">Through religious ceremonies of great import, Heroes may attempt to teach subordinates in the intricacies of Dust manipulation. The exercise nevertheless provides insight into the Hero's decision-making and grants an air of divine significance to their commands. Crews come to believe there could be no cause more righteous than that which they fight for. This ultimately results in more alert and precise fleets that battle with peerless discipline.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L05ShortTitle">Labor Corps Program</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L05Title">Orders to Expand Soldier Duties to Minimize Economic Loss</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LawP06L05Description">One of the weaknesses of many militarized societies is the dormant labor of soldiers on duty, and industries turned from growth to munitions, representing a net loss for society. By merging defence forces with unions or guilds to create controlled militia, investing in the flexibility of manufacturers, implementing military job training programs, and shortening the minimum tour of duty, this weakness can be entirely reversed during peacetime, and strongly mitigated during war.</LocalizationPair>

	<LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00MajorGrowthOnlyTitle">Command for the Restriction of Demographic Variability</LocalizationPair>
	<LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00MajorGrowthOnlyDescription">With enough support, carefully presented data and appeals to the national mythology can help to pass a most controversial law: that only the primary species of the empire be allowed to grow. All other species, whatever their breeding habits, are permitted to retain their current population under a one-to-one offspring fiat enforced by new surveillance agencies, while the original species is encouraged to grow.</LocalizationPair>

	<LocalizationPair Name="%LawP00MinorGrowthOnlyDescription">It has been well known for centuries that genetic diversity ensures someone, somewhere is going to survive any given event, and total annihilation of the population is less and less likely. Applied to a multi-species society, this means that it is best to retool public programs for alien needs, and focus them on the smallest groups first to ensure long term resilience to harm.</LocalizationPair>
