  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip3Title">To Colonize a System, you must first create an Outpost on one of its planets, and populate it using Outpost Actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip4Title">Exploration ships can use Probes to either reveal Curiosities or look for isolated star systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip6Title">You can activate the tutorial at any time through the game options.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip7Title">The border of your empire grows depending on the influence of your systems. The more a system produces, the faster its border expands.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip8Title">Each political ideology provides a mandatory law, guiding your strategy. In addition, you can vote more laws from the elected parties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip9Title">Cravers start as an Autocracy. Only a single party is permitted in the Senate, only the Main Population votes, and Anarchy cannot occur.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip10Title">Your system can be developed by consuming luxury resources once you have unlocked the proper technology. Developing a system provides a permanent boost. Be careful about how you specialize your empire!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip11Title">Trading Companies are created by building a Headquarters. It will then create Trade Routes from the star system it’s located in to all systems with a Subsidiary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip12Title">You can invest in a Trade Company from the Economy Screen in order to increase their Trade Routes' income.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip14Title">A part of your growth is converted every turn to fill your Manpower. It is then used by your ships and systems to generate troops during ground battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip15Title">Once a Behemoth is turned into Citadel, it cannot be moved or scrapped.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip16Title">The more Behemoth technologies you research, the more Behemoths you'll be able to control.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip17Title">A Behemoth can be specialized into any type of ship; a support Behemoth can become a Juggernaut.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip18Title">The Strategic Resource cost to fire an Obliterator decreases each turn, eventually reaching zero.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip19Title">Combine a Citadel and an System Shield to completely negate any damage from Obliterator missiles.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip20Title">Regular Technologies' icons are circles, Deeds are diamonds and Behemoth techs are hexagons. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip21Title">Keii is generated by winning Space and Ground Battles, or by completing Deeds and Quests. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip22Title">Hisshos will lose Keii if they retreat from a Battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip23Title">Hissho take longer to settle an Outpost, and the process must be completed by using Keii (the cost in Keii decreases each turn, but is never 0).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip24Title">Thanks to the Hissho Affinity, population is able to live on any planet without suffering penalty. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip31Title">Unallocated Bandwidth will grant you a small Hacking Speed bonus.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip32Title">Hacking a Home System yields much better outcomes than a regular System. Don't forget to defend yours appropriately!</LocalizationPair>

  <!-- ESG -->
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip5Title">Blockading a Star System will prevent most factions from being able to colonize it</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip33Title">Make sure you use your influence! Laws are very powerful tools you don’t want to be missing out on.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip34Title">Sophons have excellent ships, with each ship having an extra slot with no limitations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip35Title">Quality over quantity! Horatio’s ships have one less module slot then other faction’s ships, but have bonus health and shields equal to a portion of the industry cost used to produce them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip36Title">Be careful around the Lumeris! They colonize quickly and ignore blockades.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip37Title">Every faction has a unique behemoth module available to them on the Juggernaut Blueprints technology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip38Title">Bombers are powerful weapons for taking out larger ships quickly; make sure you don’t neglect them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip39Title">Trade Companies are an incredibly effective way to increase your luxury resource production, though they will take time to develop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip40Title">Food is important not just for growing new populations, but also for growing your manpower.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip41Title">Explorers can turn invisible once you research Vacuum Protection, allowing them to effectively scout enemy territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip42Title">Modules with effects highlighted in #C48594#Red#REVERT# scale depending on the size of the ship. Modules with effects highlighted in #6999D5#Blue#REVERT# scale with the size and level of the ship equipping them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip43Title">Modules that require strategic resources to use often have unusual effects that could turn the tide of a battle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip44Title">Are an enemy’s defenses too potent? Try softening up their system with a few planet crackers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip45Title">A Faction Pact benefits both empires involved, with the bonus given to you being determined by the faction you are signing a pact with.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip46Title">Be careful not to let your diplomatic pressure get too high, if it reaches the minimum then the other faction can make a devastating demand. Declaring war will prevent/negate this effect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip47Title">Influence is used for diplomacy, laws, and powerful repeatable system improvements. Make sure not to use it all in one place.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip48Title">Controlling a majority of the systems in a constellation will provide a powerful bonus.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip49Title">The Unfallen may be slow to spread, but once they have vined a planet it is hard to get rid of them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip50Title">The United Empire has the ability to spend influence to instantly complete or purchase technologies, buildings, ships and resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip51Title">The Nakalim can build a Temple on a planet, allowing them to convert nearby systems very quickly. However, this comes at the cost of reducing the natural output of that planet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip52Title">The Hissho aren’t great at controlling many systems, and compensate by mining planets with Behemoths. The economic gains from their unique mining abilities generally exceed those from colonization!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip53Title">Minor populations will provide a special empire-wide bonus when there are 20 of them within your empire. Major populations will provide a powerful empire-wide bonus when there are 50 of them within your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip54Title">Boosting a population in the Population Overview screen will double the rate at which that population type grows, while also doubling its innate bonuses. Each population type has its own preferred resource you need to boost it with.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip55Title">Every action you take will affect the political opinion of your citizens, take your actions carefully!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip56Title">You do know best! Dictatorships choose which party gets to be in power twice as often, switch to whatever party suits your empire's needs. In addition to these, they get a reliable set of always available independent laws!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip57Title">Republic is a great government for empires with a lot of influence to spend, their laws are much more effective than anyone else's.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip58Title">If you want to pass more laws at once (at reduced cost!), Democracy is an amazing government type.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip59Title">If your empire is having trouble expanding, the Federation government type would be perfect for you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip60Title">Kinetic weapons will be mostly absorbed against well-armored ships, maybe try using some energy weapons instead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip61Title">Shields are fantastic for absorbing energy weapons, but don’t underestimate their value against kinetic weapons as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip62Title">Beams are well rounded weapons good for almost every situation, but don’t have any notable strengths.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip63Title">Missiles may provide a lot of damage, but they can be shot down by enemy flak. Maybe try mixing in some Swarm Missiles with your Missiles to confuse enemy flak.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip64Title">Know your opponent hasn’t been manning their ships properly? Attacking ships with boarding pods kills the crew, and once all the crew is dead you will take the ship for yourself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip65Title">Ships get a bigger damage bonus the closer they are to being completely manned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip66Title">Critical hits will ignore enemy shields and armor, allowing you to quickly shred well-defended ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip67Title">The Blast Effect Battery can be used to utterly decimate fleets with many small ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip68Title">Make sure you manage Approval properly! Letting your citizens get unhappy could lead to revolt. Content citizens produce more food and influence, with angry citizens producing less food and influence.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip69Title">Curiosities aren’t just there to show you where resource deposits are, sometimes they have powerful weapons and buildings.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip70Title">EMPs can be used to disable either an enemy’s weapons or shields. This can be a very powerful tool if you use it properly!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip71Title">Invading systems will require a lot of time and effort, softening it up by sieging it for a few turns can make the battle go much more in your favor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip72Title">Minor factions are nothing to scoff at, some have powerful faction traits, others have powerful population. Acquiring them is always a boon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip73Title">Coordinators are great for absorbing powerful hits, and can be fitted with powerful modules that provide flotilla-wide buffs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip74Title">Pick your tactics cards carefully! Many have negative effects that could not only cripple your enemy, but also YOU if you use them incorrectly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip75Title">Don’t ignore your faction quest, it can provide you with powerful bonuses and abilities that will be useful to you the whole game.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip76Title">You can manage your entire empire from the Empire Summary screen, without even having to look at the galaxy map.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip77Title">Be careful when entering an Unfallen’s territory, the vines slow down your ships if you aren’t friendly with them, while speeding up theirs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip78Title">Need to boost sheer production of ships and buildings quickly? The Industrialist Party has the laws you need.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip79Title">If you have a variety of strong population types or anomalies and want to make use of them, Ecologist Party laws are ideal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip80Title">To dominate the enemy in battle and save on the costs of your navy, use the laws of the Militarist Party.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip81Title">The Pacifist Party laws are excellent for making new friends and turning a profit from galactic business like Luxuries and Trade Routes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip82Title">If you need to know your enemy and bypass their defenses, the Scientist Party can help you gain the advantage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip83Title">The Religious Party can help you build a strong economy despite a lack of territory or resources by harnessing Heroes, special nodes, and the spoils of your enemies worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip84Title">Plan on killing a lot of ships in the near future? Modules and hero skills that provide a resource per Command Points destroyed could give you a powerful surplus of said resource.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip85Title">Don’t have any planets left to colonize? Your colonization ships could be converted into siege or invasion ships that batter an enemy’s defenses!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip86Title">Trade agreements give you access to luxuries produced by other empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip87Title">Pay attention to the innate bonuses of your populations, it could be worthwhile to send them to a more effective system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip88Title">Mercenary Ships have an improved privateering, though at an increased cost. It may be a good idea to... keep your Ally in check next time they act up.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip89Title">Hot planets are great for producing industry, but tend to have terrible science. Next time you’re looking for additional industry, it may be a good idea to colonize a system with multiple hot planets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip90Title">Fertile planets are the perfect climate for growing food and holding population. If you’re wanting to grow a lot of population and quickly, a Fertile planet is your best bet. Fertile planets tend to not produce as much industry or science per population though.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip91Title">Cold planets are the ideal planet type to set up some laboratories to produce research. If you’re ever feeling behind in the tech tree, a Cold planet might be the thing you need to catch up, though be wary that it will be hard to build infrastructure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip92Title">Sterile planets are good for specializing into a specific resource determined by planet temperature, and innately produce more dust than fertile planets. Though they tend to not have as many population slots as Fertile planets, they have more than a gas planet will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip93Title">Nakalim players can’t produce science from planets, meaning cold planets are entirely useless to them. This is also the ideal place to build temples, since the malus doesn’t affect you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip94Title">If you’re willing to wait, send a Warning and a Prepare for War declaration, and after the warning expires you will be able to declare war for free. The best part is, if you decide it’s not worth waiting you can still declare a surprise war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip95Title">Finding diplomacy too expensive? Send a praise to another faction, it drastically lowers the cost of positive diplomacy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip96Title">All Trading Company headquarters will trade with every trading subsidiary, and vice versa. However, headquarters will not trade with each other, and similarly subsidiaries will only trade with headquarters.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip97Title">Bombers do not take accuracy penalties and ignore enemy evasion, great for dealing with pesky Umbral Choir fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip98Title">Trade routes produce dust and luxuries primarily based on the level of development of the systems containing the headquarters and subsidiary. This enables them to scale as your overall empire develops!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip99Title">Trade routes will generate luxury resources not only from the systems containing the headquarters and subsidiary, but also from the directly surrounding colonized systems. However, other systems along the trade route will NOT contribute luxuries.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%LoadingTip100Title">The more industry something costs to build, the greater the dust cost to buyout, so buyouts can get very expensive very quickly. It’s more effective to buy out cheaper buildings than expensive ones.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementQuestVaultersManpowerFromScienceTitle">Militarized Social Networks</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EmpireImprovementQuestVaultersManpowerFromScienceDescription">As stellar distances grow, the clannish independence of Vaulter culture has come to the forefront, making local militia and clubs of researchers more powerful than regular armies and universities.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitCheaperAirUnitsTitle">Air Gondoleers</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitCheaperAirUnitsDescription">Lush peaks, toxic valleys, flying landmasses, or extremely vertical islands have forced this culture to mass produce the cheapest forms of air travel, from balloon-assisted cable cars to modern jet taxis, and this experience has extended to vast, low cost air fleets converted from civilian life.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitCheaperArmorUnitsTitle">Heavy Metal Nomads</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitStrongerArmorUnitsTitle">Steel Knights</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitStrongerArmorUnitsDescription">Perhaps a cavalry culture at one point, tank crews have replaced small circles of knights as the storied spearpoint of the military; tales abound of grease-smeared heroes struggling forward through the enemy ranks, returning from the smoke with machinery broken but heads held high in victory.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitHealthyArmorUnitsTitle">Moving Fortresses</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTraitHealthyArmorUnitsDescription">A rarity even on the most wide-open planets due to the requirement for powerful manufacturing centers, this factions vehicles can become truly gargantuan, as gravity repulsors provide lift merely as a support to these mighty land-ships incredible weight where other factions would use them for aircraft.</LocalizationPair>
